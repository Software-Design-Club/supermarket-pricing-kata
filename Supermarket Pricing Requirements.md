## Questions to consider
  does fractional money exist?
  when (if ever) does rounding take place?
  how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
  are costs and prices the same class of thing?
  if a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?
